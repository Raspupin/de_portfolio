Over the past two years, I have worked as a tutor, guiding students in data structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, and SQL fundamentals. My technical expertise includes backend development with Node.js, Express.js, and Java, as well as frontend development with React. I also have experience working with SQL and Python, working with databases, and handling data processing tasks.Beyond development, I have participated in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data analysis and worked with web scraping using Selenium in Java, managing and processing data through Google Sheets automation. Currently, I am deepening my skills in backend development, focusing on scalable server-side architectures, database management, and API development. I am eager to bring my passion for clean, efficient code and problem-solving to any project I'm in.",
